# Capslock-Forge

Use the Caps Lock key as a modifier key, with its behavior fully configurable by the user.

For a highly polished similar product, see [capslock-plus](https://github.com/wo52616111/capslock-plus) .

## Simple Demonstration

## Instructions

With custom configuration, users can easily input any special characters and define simple key combinations.

Users can customize all key bindings and behavior, configuring them as needed.

After launching the program, a `csonfig` folder will appear in the running directory. Inside, you'll find configuration files along with instructions. These files serve both as default configurations and examples.

## Others

- Only supports Windows.
- This is still an early version, with plans for continuous updates, though progress may be slow.
